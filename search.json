A critical point was that i didn’t knew anything about quarto, nor github action, so that took me a long time. This page update on push and schedule via a github action I find, available on the repo if sommeone need it. Another critical point was that i wanted to create my own svg’s using python. My first idea was to pars and text edit a svg file, but i after a while i realised it was probably note a good idea and in the end i resigned myself to used some basic available shaped online. it still did teach me a lot about image manipulation and i’ve learn to use the very nice drawsvg library, so it wasn’t to much of a waste."
